    "text": "Introduction and data\nThis dataset is aggregated from the FBI Hate Crimes Report for 2013. The data was collected in 2016 by accessing statistics across states from the FBI Hate Crimes Report website, which is open access (https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/hate-crime/2013). The dataset contains two csv files with a table detailing demographics for agencies that reported incidences of hate crimes in 2013 and another for those that reported no incidences of hate crimes in 2013. These tables contain 1826 and 12826 observations, respectively. The first table contains the variables state, agency type (city, university, county, etc.), agency name, and the number of occurrences in each motivation category of hate crime — race, religion, sexual orientation, ethnicity, disability, gender, and gender identity. Additionally, there are columns that indicate the number of hate crime occurrences in each quarter. Finally, the last column details the population of the location of the hate crime. The second table, because it omits the motivation details, only contains columns for state, agency type and name, quarter, and population. There are a few ethical concerns with this data. Perhaps most prominent, as the literature review later mentions, the incidents in this report are only those that law enforcement has determined meets the criteria for a hate crime. This means, if such criteria is especially constrictive, the dataset may be underreporting the true frequency of hate crimes."

    "text": "Research question\nHow has hate crime victimization and frequency changed since 2013?\n\nThis question is important because it can be used to quantify social progress in our country, as well as inform stats-based policy reform and resource allocation for minority populations.\nIn an ethnically, racially, religiously and sexually diverse nation, hate crimes are one of the many substantial barriers to our functioning as a safe and accepting society. 2013 was a year in which the political climate of the United States was less accepting of diverse identities compared to today’s social atmosphere. Specifically, 2013 was pre- legalization of same sex marriage and pre- black lives matter. I hypothesize that the data (when analyzed along with more recent data) will reveal a decrease in hate crimes targeting persons with disabilities as well as those targeting religious, sexuality, and gender minorities since 2013, with an increase in hate crimes targeting racial and ethnic minorities. Overall, I predict higher levels of hate crimes in the race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender and gender identity categories. I also think that there will be higher occurrences of hate crimes in general in historically red states/counties.\nThe variables state and agency type are both categorical. The population variable and variables for the number of hate crimes in each quarter and minority category are quantitative."

    "text": "Literature\nhttps://doi.org/10.1037/sgd0000227\nThis source discusses the documentation and data reporting of hate crimes in the United States. Specifically, it details which of the most commonly cited sources are the most reliable. While this article is looking at only hate crimes targeting gender and sexual minorities, I think the information is useful and relevant regardless. The paper concludes that reports made to local (non-law enforcement) organizations are valuable sources of data, but this can exclude a number of people such as closeted individuals and those living in areas that are not served by such an organization. As for FBI data, the strengths lie in the reliability, accuracy, and accessibility, as well as the guarantee that the observations included are only those confirmed to meet the standardized legal criteria of a hate crime. However, the aforementioned strength can also be a weakness. Because many hate crimes are not fully investigated and confirmed to be hate crimes, or not reported by victims at all, the data is likely reporting a significant underestimate of the true frequency of these crimes.\nThe literature above is useful for determining which sources are the most accurate for reporting on hate crime frequency, and it specifically details the pros and cons of using the FBI’s hate crime report data. Our project can utilize this literature by acknowledging those strengths and weaknesses in our own research, and possibly looking for other reliable sources reporting on the same years to compare with the FBI data."

However, we keep in mind that players’ salaries are influenced beyond just statistics, such as the year the player was playing in the NBA and the team the player played for, so we keep that into consideration.

Player performance and team revenues: NBA player salary analysis.\n\nProvide a one paragraph summary about the article.\n\nThe article conducts a study to determine if NBA players are appropriately paid based on their contributions on the court by looking at and calculating their offensive statistics, defensive statistics, amount of wins the player was responsible for, and age. The article went over the salary cap in the NBA and the CBA (collective bargaining agreement) as it does play a role in how team owners and the NBA distribute player’s salaries. The article mentioned that they considered many factors in the player’s performance, such as the number of minutes played per game, the position the player plays for, and the amount of wins the player contributed. For example, it doesn’t make sense if a player who plays fewer minutes is as valuable as a player who plays more minutes on the court. The article concludes that salaries are affected based on these factors: TV contract revenues, the number of years in the NBA as older players tend to earn more money than younger players, and the amount of points scored per game as players who score more tend to be paid more. However, looking at the stat sheet won’t give a full picture of whether or not a player is valuable. Other external factors like injury status, team dynamics, and the player’s role in the team need to be considered.\n\nIn 1-2 sentences, explain how your research question builds on / is different than the article you have cited.\n\nThis article builds on what we need to focus on when we consider the relationship between statistics and NBA salaries, such as other factors to consider, like the specific time era the player played in the NBA or if the player plays in a small or large market team."

    "text": "Introduction and Data\nFor our research question, we would like to know where hate crimes occur more frequently: in states that voted democrat for the 2012 election, or in republican states? Additionally, we would like to know which minority populations are most targeted.\nThis question is important because it can potentially be used to compare to analyses of more recent data and identify risk factors for hate crime occurrences, which can then inform policy decisions. In an ethnically, racially, religiously and sexually diverse nation, hate crimes are one of the many substantial barriers to our functioning as a safe and accepting society. 2013 was a year in which the political climate of the United States was less accepting of diverse identities compared to how it is now. Specifically, 2013 was pre- legalization of same sex marriage and pre- Black Lives Matter movement. We hypothesize, due to the political climate at the time, that the data will show a positive correlation between hate crimes and states with republican politics. Furthermore, we predict that there will be a higher number of hate crime occurrences motivated by sexual orientation and race than in other categories.\nOur dataset was aggregated from the FBI Hate Crimes Report for 2013. The data was collected in 2016 by accessing statistics across states from the FBI Hate Crimes Report website, which is open access (https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/hate-crime/2013). The dataset contains two csv files with a table detailing agencies that reported incidences of hate crimes in 2013 and another for those that reported no incidences of hate crimes in 2013. These tables contain 1827 and 12827 observations, respectively.\nFrom the first table we will utilize the variable state as a location identifier and group by state, omitting specific cities and counties. We will group these states into “Republican” and “Democrat” based on which way the state voted in the 2012 election. Then, we will sum every observation for each state so we have a total number of hate crime occurrences in each state. We will also utilize the columns for Race, Religion, Sexual Orientation, Ethnicity, Disability, Gender, and Gender Identity, which will be categories for our motivation variable. State and motivation each act as categorical variables here, while number of hate crimes is quantitative.\nThere are a few ethical concerns with this data. Perhaps most prominent, as the literature review later mentions, the incidents in this report are only those that law enforcement has determined meets the criteria for a hate crime. This means, if such criteria is especially constrictive, the dataset may be underreporting the true frequency of hate crimes.\n\n\nMethodology\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(tidymodels)\n\nhatecrime &lt;- read_csv(\"data/table13.csv\")\nnohate &lt;- read_csv(\"data/table14.csv\")\n\n\nnew_hatecrime &lt;- hatecrime |&gt;\n  select(State,\n         Race,\n         Religion,\n         `Sexual orientation`,\n         Ethnicity,\n         Disability,\n         Gender,\n         `Gender Identity`)\n\npivot_hatecrime &lt;- new_hatecrime |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = -State,\n               names_to = \"Category\",\n               values_to = \"Num_Crimes\")\n\n\npivot_hatecrime |&gt;\n  na.omit(cols = \"Category\") |&gt;\n  filter(Category %in% \"Race\") |&gt;\n  group_by(State) |&gt;\n  summarize(Race_Crime = sum(Num_Crimes))\n\n# A tibble: 50 × 2\n   State       Race_Crime\n   &lt;chr&gt;

Furthermore, the mean suggests that hate crime occurs more frequently in Democratic states, but hypothesis testing suggests this may not be statistically significant.\n\n\nResults\n\nCategory Analysis:\nThe scatter plot analysis, for the year 2013, revealed that Race and Sexual Orientation are the most prevalent categories for hate crimes. Categories such as Disability, Gender, and Gender Identity reported fewer incidents, as shown by their lower positioning on the plot.\nPolitical Affiliation Analysis:\nUpon categorizing states by political affiliation, we calculated the mean number of hate crimes per state for both Democratic and Republican majorities. The mean for states with Democratic majorities appeared higher than for Republican states. However, a hypothesis test to assess the independence of hate crimes from political affiliation resulted in a p-value of 0.144. This p-value exceeds the conventional threshold of 0.05 for statistical significance, indicating that there is no substantial evidence to conclude that the political majority of a state affects the mean number of hate crimes.\n\nConclusions:\n\nThe data analysis provides insights into the distribution and frequency of hate crimes across different categories and suggests an interaction between category and hate crime frequency. However, the analysis does not support a statistically significant relationship between the political affiliation of a state and the average number of hate crimes. We cannot reject the null hypothesis that hate crime frequency is independent of state politics."

This means, if such criteria is especially constrictive, the dataset may be underreporting the true frequency of hate crimes.\n\n\nMethodology\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(tidymodels)\n\nhatecrime &lt;- read_csv(\"data/table13.csv\")\nnohate &lt;- read_csv(\"data/table14.csv\")\n\n\nnew_hatecrime &lt;- hatecrime |&gt;\n  select(State,\n         Race,\n         Religion,\n         `Sexual orientation`,\n         Ethnicity,\n         Disability,\n         Gender,\n         `Gender Identity`)\n\npivot_hatecrime &lt;- new_hatecrime |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = -State,\n               names_to = \"Category\",\n               values_to = \"Num_Crimes\")\n\n\npivot_hatecrime |&gt;\n  na.omit(cols = \"Category\") |&gt;\n  group_by(State) |&gt;\n  summarize(Total_Crime_State = sum(Num_Crimes))\n\n# A tibble: 50 × 2\n   State       Total_Crime_State\n   &lt;chr&gt;

Categories such as Disability, Gender, and Gender Identity reported fewer incidents, as shown by their lower positioning on the plot.\nPopulation and Crime Correlation:\nThrough scatter plots with a superimposed linear trend line, our analysis indicates a positive correlation between the population size of a state and the number of hate crimes reported. Larger populations tended to have a higher number of crimes, but further analysis would be required to establish causation.\nPolitical Affiliation Analysis:\nUpon categorizing states by political affiliation, we calculated the mean number of hate crimes per state for both Democratic and Republican majorities. The mean for states with Democratic majorities appeared higher than for Republican states. However, a hypothesis test to assess the independence of hate crimes from political affiliation resulted in a p-value of 0.144. This p-value exceeds the conventional threshold of 0.05 for statistical significance, indicating that there is no substantial evidence to conclude that the political majority of a state affects the mean number of hate crimes.\n\nConclusions:\n\nThe data analysis provides insights into the distribution and frequency of hate crimes across different categories and suggests a potential correlation with state population sizes. However, the analysis does not support a statistically significant relationship between the political affiliation of a state and the average number of hate crimes."
